# Project Euler

My attempts to solve the [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) problems

## ChangeLog

* 2022-03-23: Problems 52, 53, 55, 56, 57, 58
* 2021-03-04: Problems 81, 83, and 83 with my implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm
* 2021-03-03: Problems 81, 83, and 83 using NetworkX graph path finding
* 2021-03-02: Problem 96
* 2021-03-01: Problem 317
* Somewhen in February 2020, solved all problems up to 50
* 2021-02-06: Solved problems 33, 34, 35, 36, 37.
* 2021-02-05: Solved problems 29, 30, 31, 32.
* 2021-01-04: Solved problems 28 and 33
* Somewhen in January 2020, after Advent Of Code 2019: solved problems 1 to 27.


## Interesting problems according to @zar

* 19: Done in 2020 on [Problems 001-025.ipynb](Problems%20001-025.ipynb)
* 33: Done on 2021-01-04 on [Problems 026-0XX.ipynb](Problems%20026-050.ipynb)
* 54:
* 81, 82, 83: Shortest path finding in various forms. Matrix and directions can be translated in weigthed graphs. Solved using `NetworkX` methods in  [Problem 81-82-83 - NetworkX.ipynb](Problem%2081-82-8320-20NetworkX.ipynb) and with my own implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm in [Problem 81-82-83 - Dijkstra.ipynb](Problem%2081-82-83%20-%20Dijkstra.ipynb). For the latter use of `PriorityQueue` improved perfomance dramatically, otherwise I was continously sorting the keys of a dictionary...
* 84
* 89
* 96: Sudoku solver, using recursion and backtracking
* 107
* 317: Projectile trajectory physics, can be solved analytically!
